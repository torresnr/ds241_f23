Analysis done in class, using data_raw and various libraries. Shows utilization of:

- Visualizing data using ggplot2 (scatterplot, histogram, barchart, lineplot).
- Manipulating data (demonstrate dplyr verbs filter, summarise, join, select, rename, slice).
- Data loading and tidying and cleaning (to include pivot-wider and pivot-longer)
- Data science process (major steps) [Harder] - where I illustrate a broader analysis of a problem, rather that specifically illustrating particular skills. (Solve a problem, answer a question, etc.)
